Title: AI-Based Development of Laser QR Code Marking for Track Fittings on Indian Railways

Theme: Transportation & Logistics

Category: Hardware

Team Name: YOLO

Idea Title

₹1 Innovation → Smarter, Safer, Stronger Railways

Indian Railways buys crores of track fittings every year without any tracking or identification system.

This results in financial losses, zero traceability, and safety risks.

The proposed system introduces AI-powered Laser QR Code Identification to track each fitting from factory to installation to maintenance to disposal.

Problem Statement

10 crore rail clips, 5 crore liners, and 8.5 crore pads bought yearly without a tracking system.

No serial ID for clips, pads, liners, and sleepers.

No mobile scanning system for vendor info, supply date, or warranty.

Inspection history not available in UDM or TMS.

Approximate annual loss: ₹1122 crore.

Proposed Solution (₹1 Innovation)

Laser QR Codes combined with mobile scanning and AI prediction.

Each fitting receives a unique QR code: clips, pads, liners, sleepers.

Scanning provides vendor, supply date, warranty, and inspection history.

Mobile app allows scanning during installation.

AI predicts failures and evaluates vendor performance.

Automatic upload to UDM and TMS portals.

Real-time dashboard for monitoring and alerts.

Zero manual errors and Industry 4.0 compliant.

Expected savings: ₹561 crore per year.
