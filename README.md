<h3>Problem ID: SIH25021</h3>
<h3>AI-Based Laser QR Code Marking for Track Fittings on Indian Railways</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Indian Railways purchases crores of track fittings every year without a digital 
tracking system, leading to losses, safety risks, and zero traceability.  
Our solution introduces <strong>AI-powered Laser QR Code Identification</strong> 
to track each fitting from factory → installation → maintenance.
