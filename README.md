Problem Statement ID: SIH25021
Title: AI-Based Development of Laser QR Code Marking for Track Fittings on Indian Railways
Theme: Transportation & Logistics
Category: Hardware
Team Name: YOLO

⭐ Idea Title
₹1 Innovation → Smarter, Safer, Stronger Railways

Indian Railways buys crores of track fittings every year—clips, pads, liners, and sleepers—yet no tracking or identification system exists. This results in huge financial losses, zero traceability, and safety risks.

Our solution introduces AI-powered Laser QR Code Identification to track each fitting from factory → installation → maintenance → disposal.

🚨 Problem Statement

10 crore rail clips, 5 crore liners, 8.5 crore pads bought yearly—no tracking system

No serial ID for clips, pads, liners, sleepers

No mobile scanning for vendor info, supply date, warranty

Inspection history missing in UDM/TMS

Annual approximate loss: ₹1122 crore

💡 Proposed Solution (₹1 Innovation)
Laser QR Codes + Mobile App + AI Prediction + UDM/TMS Integration

✔ Each fitting gets a unique QR code (clips, pads, liners, sleepers)
✔ Scan to get instant vendor, supply date, warranty, inspection history
✔ Mobile app for scanning during installation
✔ AI predicts failures and tracks vendor performance
✔ Auto-upload to UDM & TMS
✔ Real-time dashboard for railways
✔ Zero manual error, Industry 4.0 ready

Expected Savings → ₹561 crore/year
🔧 System Workflow (Step-by-Step)
1️⃣ Laser QR Code at Factory

Each component receives a unique ID + QR code.

2️⃣ Scan During Installation

Field crew scans using a mobile app.

3️⃣ Automatic Upload

Data syncs (online/offline) to UDM & TMS.

4️⃣ AI Analysis

Predicts failures, tracks vendor performance, schedules maintenance.

5️⃣ Real-time Dashboard

Railways receive alerts, updates, and complete history.

6️⃣ Continuous Improvement

AI learns from historical data and improves maintenance accuracy.
